**Welcome to Melkor!**

Melkor is a simple, fast wiki powered by Node.js and Git.

You are looking at the default wiki homepage. Feel free to edit it.

Some of the features Melkor provides:

* All the pages are written in [Github-flavoured markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).
* All changes are stored in a Git repository.
* You can comment on individual changes - these get saved as Git commit messages.
* The page layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
* Editing and navigation is AJAX-driven, and degrades gracefully for non-JS browsers.

Use [Github-flavoured](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) markdown, including code blocks:

```javascript
function main() {
  alert("Hello Melkor!");
}
```

Enjoy :)
